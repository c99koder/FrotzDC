=======================
Bug-testing Programs ||
=======================

Unix Frotz now comes with crashme, TerpEtude, gntests, strictz, and
Unicode Test.  These are intended to excercise the interpreter and
verify that it is functioning according to spec.  You will find these
programs in the src/test/ directory.

=====================
Arrow Key Handling ||
=====================

Not really a bug, but an idiosyncracy.  In "Journey", sometimes you can't
use the right-arrow key to move from the "party commands" menu to the
"individual commands" menu.  IMHO, this is a bit sloppy, but it isn't
Frotz's fault.  Instead, use the spacebar to jump from menu to menu. 
I mistakenly attributed this to an unknown bug.  That'll teach
me to do bugtesting when I'm about to nod off to sleep.
